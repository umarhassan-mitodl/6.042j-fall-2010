**Description:** Covers conditional probability and its applications to examples including medical testing, gambling, and court cases.

**Speaker:** Tom Leighton

**Instructor's Note:** The actual details of the Berkeley sex discrimination case may have been different than what was stated in the lecture, so it is best to consider the description given in lecture as fictional but illustrative of the mathematical point being made.
